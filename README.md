# Yelp Review Text and Photo Analysis

In this project, I perform **image classification for images of Yelp reviews as well as
the identification of topics of dissatisfaction**. 

The dataset used is the [Yelp Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) composed of 7M 
text reviews as well as 200k pictures.

This image classification model uses transfer learning with Google's MobileNetV2 model
to identify different classes of pictures.

The topic identification part of the project uses the Bertopic package.
